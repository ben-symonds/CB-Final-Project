JS Notes:
-Const is the preferred storage type for arrow functions given functions are not meant to change
-Arrow functions are function expressions, technically not real functions
-Anything inside a string is considered plain text
-Using backticks(``) to insert JS into a string is called interpolation
-A float is a number with decimals, unlike an integer which has none
-Booleans are often referred to as 'flags'
-Global variables are const by convention and used as paramaters in the code
-Global variables are capitalized by convention and words seperated by an underscore
-Arrays can contain any type of data inside
-Objects cannot be iterated on directly
-JS converts object keys to strings automatically
-Method is a built-in JS function that is called with the '.' operator
-Methods take  '()' after being called because they follow the same rules as functions and require paramaters (there's exeptions)
